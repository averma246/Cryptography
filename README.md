# A Substitution Cipher

Crypt:
* @author: Scott Kaplan
* "contains main() and its helper methods"
* "invokes the program: reads the input data, uses the requested cipher to perform the requested operation (encryption or decryption), and writes the result" -- *description from assignment

Cipher:
* @author: Scott Kaplan
* "abstract class that defines how a specific cipher must be implemented as a subclass"
* "holds the secret key value used by any cipher, but it leaves the encryption and decryption methods abstract" -- *description from assignment

CaesarCipher:
* @author: Scott Kaplan
* "example subclass of Cipher" -- "implements the Caesar cipher" -- *description from assignment

SubstitutionCipher:
* @author: Ana Verma
* *description from assignment:* "For this project, you are going to implement a substitution cipher. Like the Caesar cipher, this cipher replaces each character in the cleartext with some corresponding character to form the ciphertext. While the Caesar cipher chose the replacement characters by rotating the ciphertext alphabet, the substitution cipher uses a randomly permuted ciphertext alphabet."
